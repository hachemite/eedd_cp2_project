# eedd_cp2_project
In 2024, as CP2 students, our team is working on an ambitious project to develop an autonomous wheelchair. This innovative wheelchair can be controlled via a smartphone and is equipped with sensors to detect obstacles and prevent collisions. Additionally, it features a fall detection system that sends the user's GPS location and an alert message to a designated provider using a Telegram bot. This project addresses SDGs 3, 10, and 11. Despite having no prior experience with Arduino or electronics, we are dedicated to making this vision a reality through hard work and perseverance.
