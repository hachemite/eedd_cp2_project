# eedd_cp2_project
In 2024, as CP2 students, our team is working on a project to develop an autonomous wheelchair. This innovative wheelchair can be controlled via a smartphone and is equipped with sensors to detect obstacles and prevent collisions. Additionally, it features a fall detection system using a Telegram bot. This project addresses ODDs 3, 10, and 11.
